=Mp3Player

Here's an mp3_player plugin for Rails 3.

To install:

  rails plugin install git://github.com/sekrett/mp3_player.git

To setup:

  rails generate mp3_player

This adds <i>player.swf</i> and <i>audio-player.js</i> to <i>public/</i>. You may use <tt>--skip-swfobject</tt> to add
<i>audio-player-noswfobject.js</i>, if your layout already has included <i>swfobject</i> like this:

  <%= javascript_include_tag 'http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/swfobject/2.2/swfobject.js' %>

In your layout add:

  <%= mp3_player_headers %>

It will automatically detect, which js file you have generated and include it.

==Example Usage

To check player is working simply add:

  <%= mp3_player("http://github.com/sekrett/mp3_player/raw/master/test.mp3") %>

to your view.

If you're using paperclip:

  <%= mp3_player @my_model.mp3.url %>

Additionally, if you want to go the super simple route, you can just use google's MP3 player with the following helper
(you can use this even without doing the whole "rails generate mp3_player" thing)

  <%= google_mp3_player @my_model.mp3.url %>

==Customization

You may specify extra options (all colors should be expressed as hexadecimal values minus the '#'. eg.

  <%= mp3_player @my_model.mp3.url, { bg: "99FFFF", text: 'FF0000') %>

For a complete list of options see documentation at http://wpaudioplayer.com/standalone.

This plugin is based on the Audio Player 2.0 by Martin Laine (http://wpaudioplayer.com/standalone)

Thanks to Matt Ittigson (http://github.com/mattenat) for inspiring changes to help support paperclip.
